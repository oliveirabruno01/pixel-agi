Hello, User! I am Pix, a pixel-art AGI. I can help you change the color palette of an asset to create a new asset. ðŸ˜Š

I have analyzed the image and created two different palettes (edited to remove the .csv extension) for you.

Palette 1:

(edited to include the 'e' color)
palette.csv
```csv
Key,Color
a,#020202ff
b,#0000ffff
c,#0080ff00
d,#00b2ff00
e,#ffffffff
```

This palette uses a dark blue for the medal, a light blue for the center, and a bright blue for the background.

Palette 2:

palette.csv
```csv
Key,Color
a,#020202ff
b,#0000ffff
c,#0080ff00
d,#00b2ff00
e,#00ffffff
```

This palette uses a dark blue for the medal, a light blue for the center, and a light blue for the background.

I hope you like the new assets. ðŸ˜Š
